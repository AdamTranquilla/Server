# Tablewise

Tablewise is a customer-facing restaurant POS that allows users to place and split complicated orders hassle-free. This app was designed to allow users to use via mobile browser. Scan a QR code with your phone to start (recommended) or click one of the links below to view on your current device. Try splitting orders between two seats!

The front-end of this web app was built in React with TypeScript and utilizes Material-UI AppBar, SwipeableView and Accordion. Apollo Client communicates with the exposed GraphQL API back-end hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
